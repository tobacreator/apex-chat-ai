# ApexChat AI Platform - CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Overview
This document outlines the complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline setup for the ApexChat AI Platform. The pipeline ensures code quality, security, and automated deployment to production.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main`/`develop` branches, Pull Requests

**Jobs:**
- **Client CI**: Builds and tests the Next.js client application
- **Server CI**: Builds and tests the Node.js server application  
- **Security Audit**: Runs npm audit checks for vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: Validates TypeScript compilation and code structure

**Artifacts:**
- Client build (`.next` directory)
- Server build (`dist` directory)

### 2. Deployment Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main` branch, Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**
- **Build and Test**: Matrix build for client and server
- **Security Checks**: Vulnerability scanning and security audits
- **Database Check**: Validates database schema and migration files
- **Integration Tests**: Runs end-to-end application tests
- **Deployment Preparation**: Creates deployment packages
- **Staging Deployment**: Manual deployment to staging environment
- **Production Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production
- **Verification**: Post-deployment health checks and performance tests

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment (`.github/environments/production.yml`)
- **URL**: https://apexchatai.com
- **Protection Rules**:
  - Required reviewer: `tobac`
  - Wait timer: 10 minutes
  - Required status checks: `build-and-test`, `security-checks`, `database-check`, `integration-tests`

### Staging Environment (`.github/environments/staging.yml`)
- **URL**: https://staging.apexchatai.com
- **Protection Rules**:
  - Required reviewer: `tobac`
  - Wait timer: 5 minutes
  - Required status checks: `build-and-test`, `security-checks`, `database-check`

## Workflow Features

### Security & Quality
- Automated security audits with npm audit
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Linting and code quality checks
- Vulnerability scanning for high-severity issues

### Build Process
- Matrix builds for client and server
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Artifact management and retention
- Comprehensive error handling

### Deployment Safety
- Required status checks before deployment
- Manual approval for production deployments
- Staging environment for testing
- Post-deployment verification

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Automatic CI/CD
- Push to `main` branch triggers automatic CI and production deployment
- Push to `develop` branch triggers CI only
- Pull requests trigger CI for code review

### 2. Manual Deployment
- Use "workflow_dispatch" to manually trigger deployment
- Staging deployment available for testing
- Production deployment requires all status checks to pass

### 3. Monitoring
- Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
- Review logs for any build or deployment issues
- Monitor environment protection rules

## Required Status Checks

The following checks must pass before production deployment:

1. **build-and-test**: Client and server builds successful
2. **security-checks**: No critical vulnerabilities detected
3. **database-check**: Database schema validation passed
4. **integration-tests**: End-to-end tests successful

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility and dependencies
- **Security Warnings**: Review npm audit output and update vulnerable packages
- **Deployment Blocked**: Ensure all required status checks have passed

### Debugging
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions
- Check artifact uploads and downloads
- Verify environment configuration files

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Deployment Targets**: Update deployment scripts with actual server details
2. **Add Monitoring**: Integrate with monitoring services for production health checks
3. **Performance Testing**: Add automated performance testing to the pipeline
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Implement automated rollback capabilities

## Security Considerations

- All deployments require manual approval
- Security audits run on every build
- Environment protection rules prevent unauthorized deployments
- Secrets and sensitive data are managed through GitHub Secrets
